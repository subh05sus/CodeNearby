This omission limits users’ ability to quickly navigate to the project’s official social media pages, reducing opportunities for community engagement and brand visibility. Adding a dedicated social media section will enhance connectivity and professionalism.\n\nBenefits\n-Improves user navigation and experience.\n-Provides quick access to official social media profiles.\n-Enhances brand visibility and engagement.\n\nSuggested Implementation\n-Add correct href URLs for each social media icon.\n-Use target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to open links in a new tab securely.\n-Verify that all icons have valid links to the respective platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram).\n\nContribution\nI would like to work on implementing functional and verified social media links in the footer.Please assign this issue to me.\n\nThank You",

Recommended logic:\n\n* 🧱 Ensure icons and text do **not overlap** by using responsive utility classes like `flex-wrap`, `gap-x-2`, or `text-sm`.\n* 📏 Stack buttons vertically or wrap them inside a flex column when screen width is below a certain breakpoint (e.g., `sm:` or `md:`).\n* 🔧 Consider hiding the button text on smaller devices and showing only the icons with tooltips for cleaner UI.\n\nThis will make the buttons more usable and visually clean on all devices.\n\n---\n\n### 👀 What’s wrong with the current version?\n\nCurrently, on smaller screen sizes, the icon and text inside each button overlap, causing a cramped and unreadable layout. This affects the clarity and usability of the interface—especially on mobile devices. Users expect touch-friendly and readable buttons that adapt to screen size, and this behavior breaks that expectation.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Mockup or Reference\n\nHere’s a demo video of the current UI behavior:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb7c5084-1a61-4b7f-9dab-8f6879e3cb37\n\nSuggested UI behavior:\n\n* ✅ Icons and text should adjust or stack gracefully.\n* 📱 Optimized for mobile screens without overflow or overlap.\n",

Recommended logic:\n\n- 🌙 **Moon icon** → when **Light Mode** is active (indicates \"Click to switch to Dark Mode\").\n- ☀️ **Sun icon** → when **Dark Mode** is active (indicates \"Click to switch to Light Mode\").\n- 🖥️ **Monitor icon** → when **System Theme** is selected (indicates the site follows system settings).\n\nThis will make the button more intuitive by clearly showing the active or next mode.\n\n### 👀 What’s wrong with the current version?\nCurrently, the **Appearance** button is showing a **user+ icon** instead of the expected theme-related icon. The icon is static and does not reflect the active or upcoming theme. This could lead to confusion as users expect icons to update dynamically based on the current theme, similar to platforms like GitHub or VS Code.\n\n### 🧠 Mockup or Reference\nTake a look at the current UI below to understand the existing design:  \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93ee586-c9df-45f3-9863-8e92f61fb82d\n\nSuggested icons logic:\n- 🌙 Moon (when Light Mode is active)\n- ☀️ Sun (when Dark Mode is active)\n- 🖥️ Monitor (when System Theme is active)",
